# READ YOUR CODE: A tragedy of team 4466 RABBI

Alex is your normal boy. He does robotics. But he is dangerous because he does not **READ HIS CODE**.
It contains errors such as:

- **Files that are not in the correct package**
- **Classes that have different names than their files**
- **1 metric ton of whitespace that shouldn't to be there**

The movie follows his demise as a coder as his messy code swallows him whole.
